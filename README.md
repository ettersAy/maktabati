# Maktabati

A personal documentation library and learning notebook built with VitePress. This project is designed to store my notes, guides, workflows, and project documentation in a clean, easy-to-navigate site.

## Why this repo

- Personal knowledge base for notes, ideas, and technical references
- Built with a static site generator so it stays fast and easy to maintain
- Hosted with GitHub Pages for simple cloud access
- Organized for learning best practices without overcomplicating the setup

## Tech stack

- **VitePress** for static documentation
- **Vue 3** as the underlying framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling utilities
- **GitHub Actions** for deployment to GitHub Pages

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ettersAy/maktabati.git
cd maktabati
npm install
npm run docs:dev
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal to preview the site.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run docs:dev      # Start local VitePress dev server
npm run docs:build    # Build the static site

```

If you prefer Makefile shortcuts:
